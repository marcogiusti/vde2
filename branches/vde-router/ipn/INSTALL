=== -1. WARNING ===
This experimental version of IPN is borrowing from AF_NETBEUI address family
and from bridge hooks to make life easier to developers.


=== 0. REQUIREMENTS ===
In order to run it you need a modular bridge support in your kernel:

CONFIG_BRIDGE=m


=== 1. IPN ===
To build ipn kernel modules:

make

To install:

sudo make modules_install

If you want to build for a specific kernel version don't forget to append
KERNELDIR variable after the commands, like:
make KERNELDIR=/path/to/your/kernel/version
sudo make modules_install KERNELDIR=/path/to/your/kernel/version



=== 2. KVDE_SWITCH ===
After you've built and installed ipn you can build kvde_switch kernel module:

cp Module.symvers kvde_switch/
cd kvde_switch
make                            # Use KERNELDIR= to build and install
sudo make modules_install       # for a specific kernel version

To use kvde_switch kernel module you have to recompile vde2 adding
"--enable-kernel-switch" to configure options, e.g.:
./configure --enable-experimental --enable-kernel-switch


=== 3. USAGE REMINDER ===
Please remind that this version of IPN is sharing hooks with linux bridging,
this means you cannot have ipn.ko and bridge.ko loaded at the same time.
