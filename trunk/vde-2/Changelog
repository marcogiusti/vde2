VDE 2.2.1, 2008-06-17
	* New contact email address: <info@v2.cs.unibo.it>
	* Code cleanup (some more warnings removed)
	* [vde_crytcab] Cleared large memory leak due to missing
	  EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup() after encryption/decryption
	* [vde_cryptcab] Cleared (very small) memory leak in crc32 calls
	* [vde_cryptcab] Fixed bug on handover after session timeout: now client
	  re-establishes the connection when it sees some traffic, after session
	  timeout.
	* Heavy directories reorganization, all source code moved under src and
	  include
	* New internal library libvdecommon.la with common utilities and LIBOBJ
	  replacement/compatibility functions
	* [common] Fix in poll emulation management
	* Fix to distclean problem due to wrong LIBOBJ management
	* [vde_switch] hash/setsize 0 was not recognized as an error and caused vde_switch
	  to hang due to an infinite loop
	* Don't compile cryptcab if configure detects not to.
	* Fix for autotools in Slackware
	* [vde_cryptcab] refactoring:
	  - simplified protocol (though keeping it back-compatible)
	  - fixed some bugs and memory leaks
	  - added some new features
	* [vde_switch] fix on BPDU generation/handling: do not generate BPDU if FSTP is not active
	  or we are HUB, forward BPDU if FSTP is not active (Closes #1943973 on SF).
	* [slirpvde] include limits.h on linux as well.
	* [vde_switch] Applied patch from Bjorn Mork to remove 32/64 bit confusion from bitarray.h
	  (Closes #1984460 on SF).
	* [vde_switch] do not update last_seen in hash entry if data arrives from
	  a new port and entry still contains old port (Closes #469098 debian).
	* [vde_cryptcab] server side:
	  - Added feature: cleanup key files on exit
	  - Bugfix: avoid using several switch ports for the same client
	* [vde_switch][libvdeplug] fixed path management: as paths are sent between
	  different processes with potentially different CWDs, we must assure that the
	  exchanged paths are always absolute ones.
	  - added vde_realpath (similar to realpath(3) but with the resulting path
	    well-defined also in case of partial resolution), taken from xmview's
	    canonicalize. vde_realpath is now part of libvdecommon.
	  - [vde_switch, kvde_switch] socket name in datasock gets canonicalized
	  - [vde_switch, kvde_switch] restored CWD of the switch after each module
	    initialization (so each module initializes with the same CWD. consmgmt
	    called daemon(0, 0) which changed the CWD to /, so the behavior was
	    different when the switch ran in background or in foreground.
	  - [vde_switch] clarified some error messages
	  - [libvdeplug] improved the fallback mechanism in case of no socket
	    specified on the command line and for data socket directory. Now the
	    default positions for the ctlfd are tried only if socket is specified.
	  - [libvdeplug] socket names get canonicalized
	  - [libvdeplug] added a missing / in datasock name
	* [kvde_switch] added a missing include
	* [slirpvde] added some checks for successful connection to the VDE switch.
	* integrations and corrections to some manual pages
	* [libvdemgmt] fixed memory leaks (Closes: #1948369 on SF)

VDE 2.2.0-pre2, 2008-01-31
	* [vde_autolink][unixcmd] Added man pages
	* Code cleanup (removed warnings, added missing prototypes to header
	  files, etc.)
	* Debian cleanup (in order to make lintian happier)
	* [slirpvde] Fix for 64 bit architectures (thanks to Andrea Arcangeli)
	* Added very very very experimental kvde_switch (using IPN)
	* Minor fixes

VDE 2.2.0-pre1, 2007-11-02
	* Fixes in vde_cryptcab, libvdeplug, vdeq, slirpvde
	* wirefilter can connect directly to two local plugs
	* libvdeplug_dyn is a variant of libvdeplug that allows dynamic
	  loading at runtime
	* Added vde_switch debug menu for asyncronous notifications
	  [experimental]
	* Added plugins support to vde_switch [experimental]
	* New sample plugins: dump and pdump (based on libpcap)
	* Added debug menu for asynchronous notifications in vde_switch
	  [experimental]
	* Added KVM symlink to vdeq
	* Enabled features summary at end of ./configure
	* Configuration files moved from /etc/ to /etc/vde2/ (and ~/.vde2/)
	* Ported to FreeBSD
	* Added vde_tunctl (imported from uml_utilities to avoid useless
	  dependencies
	* New tools and libraries: libvdemgmt, unixcmd, vde_over_ns, vde_l3,
	  vde_autolink, vde_snmp

VDE 2.1.6, 2006-12-21
	* Creation of changelog
	* vde_switch and slirpvde didn't detach from terminal when in daemon mode
	  (thanks: Piotr Roszatycki)
	* Patch for group-level privileges; -m option added to vdeq and vdetap
	  (thanks: Piotr Roszatycki)
	* Added #ifdefs for some signals, for better portability (thanks: Piotr
	  Roszatycki)
	* Fixed LD_PRELOAD examples in vdetaplib help and man page (thanks:
	  Piotr Roszatycki)
	* Typos in vde_switch man page
	* Typos in wirefilter man page (thanks: Helmut Grohne)
	* Missing cleanups in vdeq (thanks: Piotr Roszatycki)
	* Various fixes in vde_cryptcab source code; added callback to prevent
	  direct calling of vde_cryptcab.c functions from within blowfish.c;
	  added prototypes for some functions (thanks: Dann Frazier)
	* libvdetap should not use system calls but the next function in the
	  dynamic library symbol list (thanks: Piotr Roszatycki)
